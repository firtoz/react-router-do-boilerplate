# React Router Durable Objects Boilerplate

This project is a boilerplate for creating a React Router application with Cloudflare Durable Objects. It's set up as a monorepo using Bun and Turborepo for efficient management and building.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `apps/`:
  - `web-app`: Contains the React Router application
  - `worker-app`: Contains the Cloudflare Worker configuration
- `durable-objects/`:
  - `example-do`: Contains the Example Durable Object
- `packages/`:
  - `biome-config`: Biome (linter/formatter) configuration
  - `cloudflare-worker-config`: Cloudflare Worker type definitions
  - `hono-typed-fetcher`: Type-safe fetcher for Hono apps and Durable Objects
  - `wrangler-config-helper`: Utilities for Wrangler configuration

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20 or later recommended)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (latest version)
- [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) (v3 or later)

This project is set up to use Bun and Turborepo. While it may be possible to use npm or Yarn, this is not officially supported.
